Initially we will create different classes to handle different things:

*MainWindow inherits from QMainWindow
-This class will manage the main components of our user interface, like menus, toolbars , and status bars

*PlayerControls
-create a "PlayerControls" class that can encapsulates
-It will encapsulate the play, pause, stop, next, and previous buttons
-For the further developments it could include sliders for volume and track progress

*PlaylistManager
-Manages the playlist, including adding, removing, and changing the order of tracks

*AudioPlayer
-Handles audio playback which we will use PortAudio or another library
-It will manage everything related to playing sound, opening files, managing buffers, and controlling playback state

*Song - We will create this one later
-The Song class could represent each track, including metadata like title, artist, album, and file path
